This project is built to simulate real-world trading operations with features like portfolio management, trade execution, and market data visualization.

## Key Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Asset management (buy, sell, hold)
- Portfolio tracking and performance overview
- Trading mechanism/strategy execution
- Transaction history and trade logs
- Real-time or simulated market data integration

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (v18.x or later)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for package management)
- **MongoDB** or **SQL Database** (depending on your setup)
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js / Next.js (choose based on your project)
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js + Express / NestJS
- **Optional**:
  - Docker (for containerized deployment)
  - Redis (for caching or pub/sub if real-time updates are needed)
  - WebSocket / Socket.io (for live market data updates)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mechanismtrade.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd mechanismtrade
```

3. Install server and client dependencies:

```bash
# For backend
cd server
npm install

# For frontend
cd ../client
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in both `server` and `client` folders (example):

```env
# Server (.env)
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MARKET_API_KEY=your_market_data_api_key
```

```env
# Client (.env)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

5. Run the development servers:

```bash
# In server folder
npm run dev

# In client folder
npm run dev
```

Now open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) ðŸŽ¯
